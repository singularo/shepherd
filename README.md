Shepherd
========

Shepherd is a web based administration tool for web sites using the 
[OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) Container Platform.

The development environment for Shepherd requires an instance of the Shepherd 
Drupal app running in Docker on your host machine and a
[Minishift](https://www.openshift.org/minishift/) virtual machine - which 
provides an OpenShift cluster for local development. The 
[oc](https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases) command line tool enables 
interaction with the OpenShift cluster.
